This project is built using OpenCV, Mediapipe and CV Zone(version 1.5.3) libraries. OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.
Mediapipe offers opensource cross-platform, customizable ML solutions for live and streaming media. Not to mention the Numpy library which brings the computational
power of languages like C and Fortran to Python, a language much easier to learn and use.(which is basically used for image processing, quantum computing, statistical
computing, signal processing etc.)

The modules in the following project are:
1. Finger Counting: This is the module detects a human hand and counts the number of fingers being held up and displays the finger count.
2. Gesture Volume Control: By adjusting our first finger and thumb we can control the volume of our system.
3. Virtual Calculator: A virtual calculator which takes the inputs based on our finger positions, performs the desired calculations and shows us the output on the screen.
4. Hand Distance Measurement: Measures the distance between a person’s hand and a computer’s webcam.
5. Hand Distance Measurement Game: Measures the distance between a person’s hand and a computer’s webcam as well as we can play a gamme in which we have to pop up the
   bubbles which appears on the screen using hand gestures.
6. Snake Game: It's a snake game in which we hover our finger in different directions to control the movement of the snake, the aim is to get the snake to eat maximum
   number of donuts while preventing it from getting in touch with itself.
